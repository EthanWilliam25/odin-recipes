Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project’s Foundations course.  
The goal of this project is to build a simple recipe website using basic HTML.  

By completing it, I will demonstrate skills such as:  
- Setting up a project with Git and GitHub  
- Writing clean and structured HTML  
- Using text elements, lists, links, and images  

This project will serve as the starting point of my web development journey
